This is a simple example using Node JS and CRMWebAPI to call a function and then several CRUD operations against an On-Premise CRM.

This example uses client credentials hard coded and clearly isn't a pattern to follow for production applications and is intended to simply demonstrate how to call an action from Node.

# Steps to uses

1.  run npm install to restore node_modules folder 

2.  Edit index.js and update the server and apiConfig with your Org URL and credentials

5.  Run the sample e.g.  node index.js
